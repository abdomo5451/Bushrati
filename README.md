# Bushrati: A Living Story

This project is a personal and living digital space dedicated to my girlfriend, Bushra, celebrating our journey, shared memories, and future dreams.

---

### **Description**

Bushrati.site is a private, single-page website built as a surprise birthday gift. It serves as an interactive museum of our relationship, featuring a timeline of important dates, a gallery of shared interests, and interactive elements that capture the essence of our connection. The design is modern, responsive, and built to be an elegant and intimate experience.

### **Reason & Goal**

The initial reason for this project was to create a unique and heartfelt gift for Bushra's birthdayâ€”something more lasting than a physical object.

The primary goal is for this website to be a living archive. It's not a one-time project but a digital space that will grow and evolve with us, a place where we can always return to remember the moments that define our story.

### **Future Goals**

This website is designed to be a lifelong project. The vision is for it to be updated continuously to witness and celebrate our shared life goals. Future updates will include:

* **New Milestones:** Adding new important dates and memories to our timeline as they happen.
* **Travel Log:** Creating an interactive map to document the places we travel to together.
* **Shared Achievements:** A section to celebrate our personal and professional accomplishments.
* **A Growing Story:** This website will be the digital testament to our story, evolving as we do, forever.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Framework:** Next.js (React)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Backend & Database:** Supabase (for future dynamic features)
* **Deployment:** Vercel
